    This is my senior project

    The working time attendance system is a system for help the employee and the organization.
This system provides the clock in and clock out activity to employee check their work time attendance.

    In addition, the working time attendance system provides the history working time to show the time attendance of each employee
and report of working time attendance to manage the time attendance of employee.

    The human resource does not need to use another program to get the report of working time attendance who have absent
and The director does not wait for the reporting from human resource, the director can view the report when their need.

    The working time attendance activities help the human resource solve the problem of data loss by losing the paper
and help the employee who has to go outside the company can clock in and clock out their work time attendance anywhere.
